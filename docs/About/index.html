                of the requirements was to create a website in which James created a games ladder for '8 Bit Armies' using the data stream from the devs. This website also allowed him to gain
                skills in server running and various other AWS tool.The year that James spent here gave him and his team the opportunity to travel to Canada to work with WesleyClover.</p>
